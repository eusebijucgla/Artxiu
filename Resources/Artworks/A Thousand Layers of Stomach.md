Inspired by the intricate patterns found on the shell of the ancient Asari clam, _A Thousand Layers of Stomach_ is an abstract work by A.A. Murakami, that explores the intersection of nature and technology through a creative code that replicates the natural processes of Asari clam shell formation. An on-site custom knitting machine translates the artist-generated code to produce expansive textile wall pieces that capture the evolutionary beauty of the clamâ€™s mesmerizing array of abstract shell patterns.
