You are trapped in an infinite series of island museums, you can try and escape through the black doors but you are just getting yourself deeper into trouble.

All you can do is look at the faces of the monsters and learn about them through the evil television sets.  

If you are lucky you will find a bad world that crashes the game. If this happens then you have won.
